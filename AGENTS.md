## What This Project Is

**DeckTop** is a fork of [GameConsoleMode](https://github.com/toonymak1993/GameConsoleMode).

Original project: WinUI 3 shell-replacement app for Windows gaming handhelds (Steam Deck-like experience on PC). Replaces `explorer.exe`, disables UAC, uses gamepad/D-pad as the only navigation input.

**DeckTop goal:** Strip the shell-replacement and controller-centric design. Rebuild as a desktop-first WinUI 3 launcher/productivity shell that works with mouse, keyboard, and optionally a controller.

---

## Critical Context — Read Before Touching Anything

### The codebase is currently in a dangerous transitional state.

The upstream code does the following things that DeckTop intends to remove:

1. **Writes to `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Shell`** — replaces explorer.exe with itself. If removed incorrectly, Windows will not boot to a shell.
2. **Disables UAC unconditionally at startup** (`gcmloader/gcmloaderwindow.xaml.cs:6522`) — hardcoded registry write to `ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin=0`.
3. **Uses undocumented `XInputGetStateSecret` P/Invoke** for gamepad input that is invisible to other apps.
4. **Has no keyboard or mouse navigation** — D-pad is the only navigation path in the main UI.

Do not add features or refactor UI until items 1–4 are removed. See [docs/PRIORITY.md](docs/PRIORITY.md).

## Architecture Notes

### Entry Point
`gcmloader/App.xaml.cs:23` → `gcmloaderwindow.xaml.cs` constructor → `SetupGamepad()` + `Start()` → `SetupSystemAndDesktopAsync()` → `ConsoleModeToShell()`

### The Monolith
`gcmloader/gcmloaderwindow.xaml.cs` is 12,654 lines and owns: shell registration, gamepad polling (3 loops), D-pad UI navigation, service enable/disable, UAC control, launcher integration, keyboard redirect, and exit choreography. It must be decomposed before UI work.

### Config System Bug
Settings keys referenced throughout code but **not initialized in `initialconfig()`**. If `settings.toml` is missing, silent failures cascade. Two separate `AppSettings.cs` files exist — they are not in sync. Do not add new settings keys without adding defaults first.

### Two WinUI 3 Projects
`GAMINGCONSOLEMODE` and `gcmloader` overlap. Their relationship is unclear. Do not assume either is authoritative until the project structure decision is made (see PRIORITY.md step 1).

## What To Do / Not Do

### DO
- Read `docs/AUDIT.md` and `docs/PRIORITY.md` before starting any task
- Work in the priority order defined in `docs/PRIORITY.md`
- Add defaults for every settings key you reference
- Use WinUI 3 `KeyDown`, `PointerPressed`, `FocusManager` for navigation
- Extract service logic out of `gcmloaderwindow.xaml.cs` into dedicated classes with interfaces

### DO NOT
- Write to `HKLM\Winlogon\Shell` — ever
- Disable UAC
- Add or extend gamepad/XInput code — it's scheduled for removal
- Modify `BackToWindows()` exit sequence without reading the full 19-step flow first
- Add new UI before navigation works with mouse and keyboard
- Assume `AppSettings.Load<T>(key)` returns a valid value — check for defaults

## Tech Stack

- **WinUI 3** (.NET 8, `net8.0-windows10.0.19041.0`)
- **XAML** for UI
- **TOML** (`Tomlyn`) for config at `%APPDATA%\gcmsettings\settings.toml`
- **SharpDX.XInput** — gamepad (to be removed)
- **System.Management** — WMI service control
- **CommunityToolkit.WinUI** — controls and animations
- **NAudio** + **AudioSwitcher** — audio device management
- **Flurl.Http** — HTTP client
- **Microsoft.Web.WebView2** — embedded browser

---

## Branch / PR Guidance

- Main branch: `main`
- No force pushes to `main`
- PRs should reference a step from `docs/PRIORITY.md` in the description
- Each PR should be scoped to one priority step — do not bundle shell removal with config fixes

---

## Learned User Preferences

- Split large change work into explicit passes with a bounded scope so quality does not leak across unrelated concerns.
- When executing an attached implementation plan, keep the plan file read-only (do not edit the plan document as part of the implementation).
- Name feature branches for scoped tool-driven work with the `cursor/` prefix and a short description (for example `cursor/handoff-steps-1-3-shell-uac`).
- Treat DeckTop as an independent fork line; contributing changes upstream is optional rather than assumed.

## Learned Workspace Facts

- Root `global.json` pins the .NET SDK (currently 8.0.419 with `rollForward: latestFeature`) for predictable local builds.
- Monolith decomposition introduces and extends `gcmloader/Services/` (interfaces and implementations extracted from `gcmloaderwindow.xaml.cs`).
- `use_controller_navigation` in `%APPDATA%\gcmsettings\settings.toml` defaults to **false** (desktop-first). Set **true** to enable legacy gamepad polling, D-pad UI navigation, gamepad shortcut combos, and pad mouse mode; **restart** to apply loop start/stop.
